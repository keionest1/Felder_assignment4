In my 8th grade year our principal introduced to the school the engineering program. 
He said “ we will have a meeting Thursday after school who ever wants to join come to the meeting.
 So I started to ask classmates will they be joining. Many of the children said no only two of them said 
 they will. On the Thursday after school me, Brandan, and torian walk to the cafeteria to go to the meeting.
When we arrived there were some 7th and 6th grades as well. When the principal came in he told us that this
 program will be about learning about the world of robotics. He said we will also have to see who will become 
 the captain and co captain of the robotics team. He said our next meeting will be held on Monday after school 
 and we will meet up back here. When Monday after school came we meet back up at the same spot. When the
  principal asked who wanted to be the captain I stood up to take the role as captain. 
  When I became captain I had to meet  many business people and represent the school on the news, 
  in newspaper , and at other schools and outside events. When taking the role I became a leader and role 
  model I had to get my work in class complete and my work for the program also. I became a teacher to some 
  of the students that didn't know how to build so I had to teach them how to wire and build the robot 
  just as I was learning. I had to time my self so that I would put to much of my time in the robots as 
  I need into my books. Also we had a deadline to get the robots complete so we can enter into the first 
  robotics competition. We had to work fast because we was just starting on the robots and the competition 
  was 2 weeks away.
